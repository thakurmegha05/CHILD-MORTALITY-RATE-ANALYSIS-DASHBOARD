# CHILD-MORTALITY-RATE-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD

1.Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard focused on analyzing Child Mortality Rates across countries and over time. The dashboard integrates multiple datasets including mortality rate, GDP per capita, population, and causes of death.

The goal is to understand trends and causes of child deaths globally and generate actionable insights to improve healthcare strategies and public health policies.

2.Key Features

Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query

Line & Area charts showing average child mortality rate by year

Comparative chart: Mortality Rate vs GDP per Capita

Gender-based analysis: Male vs Female mortality rates per 1000 live births

Donut chart visualizing key causes of death (e.g., prematurity, diarrhea, measles)

Slicers: Country Code & Year for interactive exploration

Population-based visuals for additional context


3.Objectives

To explore patterns in child mortality across different regions

To understand how economic conditions and healthcare quality affect survival rates

To identify the most common causes of death in children under five

To support data-driven healthcare decisions by governments, NGOs, and researchers


4.Target Users

Healthcare professionals and policy makers

NGOs and global health organizations

Public health researchers and students

Government agencies and think tanks


5.Insights & Impact

By visualizing this data, we can:

Identify vulnerable regions and prioritize resources

Track progress toward health-related UN Sustainable Development Goals

Raise awareness about preventable causes of death

Encourage investment in maternal and child health programs


6.Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop

Power Query (for ETL process)

Time Intelligence DAX functions

Interactive filters and slicers
